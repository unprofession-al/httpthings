# httpthings

`httpthings` is a lose collection of thing I commonly use when building web servers. This is
mainly for my personal used and allows me to keep the _latest way I tend to do things_ in
a central place. 

If you like these things use them by copying the snippets needed to your repo. DO NOT USE
THESE THINGS AS A REGULAR LIBRARY unless you are me. Because things will change and break
your things.

| Thing                                         | Description                                                               |
